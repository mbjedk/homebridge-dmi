# Homebridge DMI

This plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) adds meteorological observation, e.g. wind, temperature, and precipitation data, from DMI owned stations located in Denmark and Greenland and exposes them as a thermometer / hygrometer. This plugin is not affiliated with DMI and is for testing-purposes only.

## Requirements:
